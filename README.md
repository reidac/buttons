## Some Arithmetic for the Buttons Computer

In the fall of 2020, I did some assembly-style hacking
for a web toy hacked up by [Zed Shaw](https://twitter.com/lzsthw),
which I ran across on Twitter.

It's a model of a simple stack computer, with a few
registers and a minimal feature set.  It's called
"[buttons.computer](https://buttons.computer)", and it's about
boundary-crossing and the difference between "button-pushing"
and "real programming".

I wrote some programs for the Buttons computer, and
tweeted them, but they were hard-to-read screenshots.

This repo may eventually contain shareable code, but for now,
it's got annotated "assembly" listings of the programs
I hacked up.
