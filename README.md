## Some Arithmetic for the Buttons Computer

In the fall of 2020, I did some assembly-style hacking
for a web toy hacked up by [Zed Shaw](https://twitter.com/lzsthw),
which I ran across on Twitter.

It's a model of a simple stack computer, with a few
registers and a minimal feature set.  It's called
"[buttons.computer](https://buttons.computer)", and it's about
boundary-crossing and the difference between "button-pushing"
and "real programming".

I wrote some programs for the Buttons computer, and
tweeted them, but they were hard-to-read screenshots.

This repo may eventually contain shareable code, but for now,
it's got annotated "assembly" listings of the programs
I hacked up.

The examples are:

 * Computing [factorials](factorial.md)
 * The [Fibonacci](fibonacci.md) series
 * The [Collatz](collatz.md) conjecture series
 * A (bad) [Random number generator](prng.md)
 * A slow series to [compute pi](slow_pi.md)
 * A fast series to [compute pi](fast_pi.md)
 * A [square-root](sqrt.md) implementation
 * A [signum](signum.md) function fragment
 * A fast [logarithm](log.md) sum.
 * An attempt at a 1D [cellular automaton](rule30.md).
